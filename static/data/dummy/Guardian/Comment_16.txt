Damn you "mild weather", damn you to hell!
So now people only get coffees when its freezing cold? Explains why so popular in Italy, Spain etc
Perhaps we've reached coffee shop peak.
It can get pretty chilly in Northern Italy in winter - the average low temperature in Turin in January is -2 and 0 in Milan for example (compared with +5 in London).
Must be the cause because coffee shops are deserted during mild weather - say spring, summer, autumn
I wonder whether this is an early sign that selling over priced, often rather silly, hot drinks in rather staid and dull formula shops has reached a peak. Greggs and Pret have a slightly better proposition with reasonable food. Nowadays virtually every shop that can see a chance has a coffee machine and tries to grab a bit of the action. I've been expecting this Costa Growth Weak headline for a while now.
