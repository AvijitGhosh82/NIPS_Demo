Comments aren't usually open on this column which is not surprising seeing as how cranky, mean-spirited and critical we can be btl - but I just want to say how much I enjoy reading people's stories and recipes on here each week. Great stuff!
Hear! Hear!
Absolutely! It's always one of the best columns in the Guardian.
The ginger loaf is just what I was looking for. I'm getting tired of pound cake and banana bread. Now, I have something to spice up my life . . . besides my wife!
Agree, I always enjoy reading this bit, some if the recipes are a bit off, but the one today sounds like my mum's ginger cake that I've lost the recipe for so I may be making it!
