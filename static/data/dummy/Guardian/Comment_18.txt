Once was a perfect jewel of a film.
cracking film!
I found it a bit too sugary towards the end - perhaps I am too old for teenage love and angst [although I was a teenager in the 80s....]. In a way the film reminded me to a less gritty version of the 'Commitments', which I loved . I am surprised Kermode gave it 4 stars.
I also laughed, cried and bought the soundtrack album, and got it signed by Gary Clark - do I win? Seriously though, fantastic little film - more Gregory's Girl than Commitments in feel I think. A warm hug of a film, with great sound track to boot. How many films have great original songs these days?
Agree there. Super songs , and I also would be off to get the album. Prob more GG coz of the period , but really loved this. We were all laughing lots in the showing today, and it will be a DVD to get.
Thought this'd be great for my teenage daughter but it seems to be on limited release, any idea why?
Yes, very enjoyable film and surprisingly moving in places. There's a lot more to it than just the trailer.
