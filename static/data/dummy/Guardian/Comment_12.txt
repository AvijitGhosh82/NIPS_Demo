Looks like a copy of "Miles from Home" with Richard Gere and Kevin Anderson from 1988.... Sadly there really does not seem to be any new imaginative or interesting writing anymore...
Looks good. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 70mins or so of Sicario, then it became a bit predictable. I'll give it a whirl.
I saw this last night and it's genuinely the real deal.
Saw this today. Well worth a watch. Really very good.
This was a quality movie with quality acting and had a quality soundtrack. The film was just quality. Took a while to understand what Ben Foster's and Chris PIne's characters were saying as they had very thick Texan accents but bar that, this was a quality film. Funny as well with Jeff Bridges being a hoot.
A wonderful film: beautifully shot, very well acted and a script that drips out the plot with wry humour. Jeff Bridges is fantastic, as are the rest of the cast, right down to the bit parts. Derivative it may be (Coen brothers mainly), but way, way better than much of garbage spewing from Hollywood at the moment.
Don't watch the trailer first
Funny but melancholic satire with every bank robber and cowboy cliche you can think of. Great performances, terrific photography and a great soundtrack. Aimed at adults too. Go and see it.
I kind of agree that it was predictable and derivative of a lot of other movies. But strangely enough, for me, it didn't make the whole thing any less enjoyable.
Excellent film!
This keeps it up to the very end. It feels like a shorter film than it is, in a very good way.
Every film now is derivative of another in some way or another. This one does just enough to make it feel like a fresh and intriguing modern western.
Really liked it, funny and sad against a bleak, beautiful sparse landscape.Well, really liked it until the shoot out and that last scene was superfluous twaddle. Why don't film makers "do" endings?
