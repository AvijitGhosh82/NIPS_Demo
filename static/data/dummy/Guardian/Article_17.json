I gave her her first UK airplay on 6 Music in 2014, which I\u2019m very proud about. It\u2019s great now that she\u2019s hit the big time. When I saw her live, I thought this is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen: contemporary dance mixed with a big light show. It\u2019s an entire artistic vision. It\u2019s not sequenced and showbiz style \u2013 there are no sequins. It\u2019s different from what you\u2019d expect from a pop star. She gets quite emotional on stage, the audience gets emotional as well and it\u2019s a beautiful moment we all share."

        "text": "I love ballet, probably because it\u2019s one thing I could never, ever humanly do. Watching the dancers takes you into a completely different space. I find it really helpful for working out problems. Most of the music is by Tchaikovsky, and it\u2019s choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan. The first two-thirds are classical ballet, so pretty and lovely, then at the end, when Anastasia is in a mental institution, there\u2019s German expressionist modern dance. It jars because it is disturbing and brutal. It\u2019s so demanding for the prima ballerina. You have to be an incredible dancer and proficient in so many kinds of dance."

        "text": "This is a film I\u2019ve seen many times, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing again because the BFI has its Scorsese season beginning in January. I could not be more excited about it as he\u2019s one of my favourite film directors. The season is also showing some films that have influenced him, a strand he has programmed. His new film, Silence, is debuting as part of the season, but I\u2019ve chosen Mean Streets because it\u2019s one of his earliest films and you can see how it\u2019s influenced every film he\u2019s done. It also made me fall in love with Harvey Keitel. It\u2019s just a very sad, sexy film."

        "text": "This is a mindfulness meditation app put together by a charitable education foundation in the US, where they teach kids in inner-city schools simple meditation techniques. There are lots of different options: things for anxiety, for getting a positive outlook on the day. The one for falling asleep is amazing \u2013 it really does the trick. The bonus is that kd lang is involved in the project, so you can pay a little extra and get her helping you do guided meditation through your earphones. It\u2019s like pouring chocolate and honey into your ears. I also love Duolingo \u2013 I\u2019ve been trying to learn some simple Polish phrases on it and I\u2019ve not been very successful, but it\u2019s a lot of fun."

WNYC is the national public radio station for New York and I listen to it via a phone app. I find it interesting to hear the kinds of things that matter to New Yorkers in their city life. A couple of broadcasters, in particular, are superb: Brian Lehrer, who has a political programme, and David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker magazine, who presents The New Yorker Radio Hour. It\u2019s always a great collection of people and topics."

This is a bookshop during the day and at six o\u2019clock turns into a cocktail bar. Friday night is poetry, but unlike any other show I\u2019ve been to. Every 10 minutes, someone will stand up, the room will go quiet, they\u2019ll read a poem for a minute or two, and then sit down and everyone carries on drinking. Another 10 minutes later, somebody else stands up and does the same thing. It punctuates the conversation in such a lovely way; the cocktails are amazing, too. It\u2019s one of those hidden places you think don\u2019t exist any more \u2013 but this one\u00a0does."

        "text": "They\u2019re the most acerbic cabaret. To call them cabaret doesn\u2019t really describe it because the lyrics are so acidic, biting, political and satirical. It\u2019s clever, super-politicised cabaret. Their appearance is quite whimsical \u2013 they\u2019re dressed in sequin onesies and huge wigs \u2013 which contrasts with the message. They sing songs about how we could save the world but we\u2019re all just too busy, we haven\u2019t got the time. It\u2019s very topical. They\u2019ve written a great, sad song about Brexit, British Values, their version of a national anthem, which is quite shocking, but so truthful. I suggested they release it as a single."
