great capitulation by doncaster....cost me a treble...& what the fuck are southend up to.... wigan cruising... hopefully next season the bookies will be more generous with their title odds for Luton....
Brammal Lane?
Very optimistic betting on Doncaster to win, they're awful
Home ground of Shefieldd United I guess.
yeah, it was for them to draw. are they really that bad? shhiiiiiiiit
Thought it might have been a mistake for the Blades to get rid of Nigel Clough, and so it has proven to be. The Blades' board has too much hubris; they think United should be in the top division by right, but unfortunately the club is very much a Division Two/Three team these days. Clough took them to two promotion play-offs in a row, and on good cup runs in each season he was in charge. Now they are floundering to get results at home against Crewe, who, no disrespect, are a Division Four team already; while Clough's Burton Albion are virtually promoted. Oh well. If managerial change is on the cards - and that seems to be the Blades' board's knee-jerk reaction to most things - then I hear Rotherham have a decent manager who might be worth having a pot-shot on next season....

certainly the worst team in the division since Ferguson took over.
There isn't a division 4 or 3 for that matter.
