The honour fell on Friday to Topman Design, the catwalk label from the high street store, with its autumn/winter show. The trends on display? Velvet, blouses for men, floral prints and colours inspired by autumn leaves and oxidised metals."

Suits were slouchily cut in panne velvet, delicate devor\u00e9 blouses had retro floral motifs, and decorative tailoring was worthy of One Direction\u2019s Harry Styles."

But even these looks weren\u2019t simple: jackets and pegged jeans had embroidered panels, with loose threads hanging down for a punk feel. It was a collection that owed a debt to 90s deconstruction by designers such as Marc Jacobs. The luxuriant fabrics and louche feel recalled rock stars from Marc Bolan to Kurt Cobain, and the retro, foppish androgyny seen in the buzzy collections of Alessandro Michele at Gucci."

Backstage, design director Gordon Richardson gave little of the inspiration away, for fear of the collection becoming pigeonholed. The 90s and the latest fashion buzzword \u201cathevening\u201d \u2013 slouchy sportswear to wear out on the town \u2013 were mentioned but not quite committed to."

The year on the collection\u2019s moodboard was 1993, he said, but the emphasis was on \u201chow that mood translates to now\u201d."

You watch it again and see something else.\u201d With 85% of the clothes on the catwalk due to hit Topman stores in the autumn, consumers represent those fresh eyes. The customer is becoming more open to menswear inspired by high fashion, as seen on the Topman Design catwalk. \u201cThey are changing, and they now want that from us,\u201d Richardson said."

Global sales of menswear in 2014 reached \u00a3298bn, up 4.5% on the previous year. London Collections: Men, partly set up in response to a burgeoning menswear market, has been a success.
