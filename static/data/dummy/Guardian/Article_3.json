        "text": "One of the great storytelling challenges of the 21st century has been describing the intangible phenomenon of the internet, especially in a visual medium such as film. Early websploitation movies like Hackers envisioned cyberspace as a kaleidoscopic theme park, while more recent dramas such as The Fifth Estate have imagined a Brazil-like world of interconnected but anonymous bodies. In this year\u2019s HyperNormalisation, Adam Curtis joined the dots between the social isolation engendered on the web and the literal isolation of a remote algorithm farm.",

        "text": "Few film-makers, though, have adequately captured the dichotomous nature of the internet as something both omnipresent and entirely abstract, like the air we breathe. That\u2019s what Citizenfour director Laura Poitras attempts in Project X, a remarkable new short made in collaboration with Henrik Moltke, which launches this Monday on video-journalism platform Field Of Vision. In it, she zeroes in on a single building in lower Manhattan to reveal the invisible pervasiveness of internet surveillance around the globe.",

According to a joint investigation by Field Of Vision and The Intercept \u2013 an online mag whose editors include former Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald \u2013 it is also an NSA spy hub. In Project X, Poitras and co-director Moltke draw from three NSA sources \u2013 a handbook for undercover domestic travel, a leaked engineering report and an internal newsletter \u2013 to trace the journey of an imagined NSA employee from the agency\u2019s headquarters in Maryland to its alleged New York City outpost.",

        "text": "Monotone voiceover performances from Rami Malek and Michelle Williams evoke the whistleblowers and government operatives of 70s American spy thrillers, as does a pulsating electronic score. Movie buffs who appreciate these allusions, however, will be disappointed to learn that Project X\u2019s title comes not from the 1987 Matthew Broderick chimp movie nor the 2012 teen comedy, but the original architectural code name of the building at its centre.",

        "text": "Before watching the film, I recommend visiting 33 Thomas Street on Google Street View. Despite the building\u2019s immense size and prominent location, its windowless facade and proximity to other New York skyscrapers render it inconspicuous in daylight. Under nocturnal observation in Poitras\u2019s film however, the faceless brutalist tower transforms into a real-life Death Star, a vast nothingness blotting out the twinkling stars and city lights. Visible only by inference, it\u2019s a fitting metaphor for our uneasy relationship with the web.",
