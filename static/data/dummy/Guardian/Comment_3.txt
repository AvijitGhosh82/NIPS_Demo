Movie buffs who appreciate these allusions, however, will be disappointed to learn that Project Xâ€™s title comes not from the 1987 Matthew Broderick chimp movie nor the 2012 teen comedy, but the original architectural code name of the building at its centre Actually real movie buffs will be thinking of the brilliant 1968 William Castle Sci fi thriller of the same name... This film is interesting less perhaps because of the conspiracy theory underlying it but because it shines a light on the forgotten pretty history of the computer and the Internet, which lies in the electro mechanical wonders of the 1950-80 telecoms revolution.  London had three of these extraordinary types of buildings, only one of which is left.
Confusing title. Is "building" a noun or a verb?
Pardon me. Not the title, the intro.
Only film buffs who are old and pretentious.
Where is the London site - and is it as architecturally beguiling?!
A real life Death Star? Hyperbole much?! Lets see it destroy a planet then! Its not even round! This article is silly!
Burne House, just off the Westway. But then I'm biased... See www.chrismrogers.net (you may have to scroll down all the way if viewing in Phone)
