Wooooooooooooo!
Was there this time last year, it is magical.
I lived on that street for two years in the 70s (on the fifth or sixth floor with no lift). I suspect the street has evolved, but I will enjoy the book. I lived opposit a green-grocer and used to wake up on Saturdays to the constant "two lettues -- un franc";; the sound bounced between the high buildings on each side and it was just as though the man was in my bedroom.
Did he really say "two"?
I tried to imagine what the author of a cynical book like this would look like and - voil√† - the grinning American lady posing with her coffee cup on a stained concrete pavement was spot on. I live just off Rue des Martyrs: a steep, congested, noisy, dirty, smelly and crime-ridden street running through Pigalle, an area notorious for prostitution, sex shows and, increasingly, Roma sneak thieves. ...Americans have been trying to turn myths about Paris into big dollars for years, but this has to be the most desperate effort to date.
