I read and re-read this article. I figured that I must be missing something. Where was the controversy? Where were the victims of misogyny? In short, what the h*ll was going on? Why did the Guardian think that anyone in their right mind (OK, I put my hands up, fair cop) would comment on this? Questions, questions, questions. Then I saw it (well, the chance to create some aggravation). Sergio is a bloke. I want to know, actually I demand to know, why a bloke was hired to turn round the fortunes of a dress shop. Were there absolutely no suitable female candidates (in a world of approximately 3.5 billion females) who could do this job? this can't be right. Right?
Not to worry staff , soon be on a zero hour contract.
I know why you're so confused - probably because you haven't looked at any of the facts. The current deputy ceo is a woman so are many of the senior executives if you check, and I'm sure they were part of the interviewing process and had a chance to pitch for the job. As the article says clothing sales are only about half of Debenhams sales so it's not a 'dress shop' and they want to grow online sales and sales of non clothing (food, beauty, gifts, homeware etc) so if you want to grow your online business why wouldn't you hire an exec from amazons fashion business who knows more about online retailing than most other ceo's at high street stores
I obviously didn't get the tone quite right. Why would I waste time looking at the facts (let's be honest, it's not a Guardian trait) when I can go straight to the point?
Bloody Immigrants coming here suppressing wages.
