I love foxygen but I've not checked these out yet. Those satin shorts are illegal in some countries. Savoy Motel are another new band that do the retro thing quite well.
Midriff-bearing? Is the shirt carrying the weight of his abs?
LIke it.  I love Big Star (see user name). My guess is that the people you're talking about are "showing their age".
I'm normally very suspicious of young bands doing something like this. It can smack of pastiche but the album is fantastic, really, really well put together. So good luck to them.
I'm turning into such a fangirl for this band. Really beautiful music and yeah, nobody's going ot get bored.
