'One of my favourite things about Christmas is definitely the carols, especially O Holy Night and In the Bleak Midwinter.' Agreed. 'The Holly and the Ivy' is another.
We're a couple of chapters away from finishing A Boy Called Christmas and my daughter, who will be six on Boxing Day, has been enthralled since the start in a way I haven't seen with any other book and she's a huge fan of reading (her name's Matilda...). She's laughed and cried and begged for just one more chapter every night. Thank you Mr Haig!
Carols from Kings is a very special part of Christmas. Once in Royal David's Cityhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=366N9k450hE
