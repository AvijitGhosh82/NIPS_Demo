You won\u2019t find it in most guidebooks, but believe me, it\u2019s a half-mile of magic. About a mile north-east of Place de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra and half a mile south of the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica, rue des Martyrs cuts through the formerly working-class ninth and 18th arrondissements. It lacks the grandeur of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the elegance of Boulevard Saint-Germain, but its activity is concentrated: it\u2019s home to nearly 200 small shops and restaurants."

Yet I\u2019ve been accepted into this tight-knit community. I have tried to make friends with almost everyone on the narrow stretch that slopes upwards into the base of Montmartre: the octogenarian showman who\u2019s been running a transvestite cabaret for more than half a century, the woman who repairs 18th-century mercury barometers, the philosophy-loving owner of a 100-year-old bookstore. I\u2019ve spent so much time on this street that the merchants and residents have embraced me and made me part of their lives."

He needs to connect with the neighbourhood where he works and lives. Gu\u00e9nard always keeps three or four tables free, just in case special friends show up. You won\u2019t be pushed out early for a second sitting; you\u2019ll be encouraged to linger as long as you like."

        "text": "This is a serious street. It made history. Tradition has it that Saint Denis, the patron saint of France, was beheaded here in the third century. Thomas Jefferson frequented the area and I am convinced that from time to time I see his ghost. Edgar Degas and Pierre-Auguste Renoir painted acrobats at the circus on the corner, Emile Zola situated a lesbian dinner club here in his novel Nana, and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut filmed scenes from Les 400 Coups. Rue des Martyrs is mentioned in Gustave Flaubert\u2019s L\u2019Education Sentimentale, arguably the most influential French novel of the 19th century, and in Guy de Maupassant\u2019s Bel-Ami."

Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, and local rock band Phoenix have recorded at Motorbass, a state-of-the-art music studio hidden behind an old wooden door painted glossy magenta. Directly across the street, jeweller Emmanuelle Zysman handcrafts designs for women and men, including delicate beaded bracelets best worn several at a time. She is one of several newcomers who mix easily with generations-old artisans on rue des Martyrs and the neighbourhood of South Pigalle (SoPi)."

Mesdemoiselles Madeleines at number 37 makes only madeleines, the little shell-shaped sponge cakes. People Drugstore at 78 offers hundreds of brands of beers (as well as chess boards for customers who choose to drink their way through a game or two). La Chambre aux Confitures (number 9, part of a small chain) sells more than 100 jams, chutneys and chocolate spreads. Premi\u00e8re Pression Provence next door specialises in French olive oil. P\u00e2tisserie des Martyrs (22) may make the best lemon tart in all of Paris. (Second-generation owner S\u00e9bastien Gaudard was voted Paris\u2019s best pastry chef in 2012.)"

And Bazar Promo (16) is a small, old-fashioned variety store that offers just about anything practical or just plain fun for apartment living, at bargain prices, with Bollywood music playing in the background. This is the place to buy nail clippers, sturdy wine glasses, cheap sports socks, doormats, tools, table fans, skipping ropes. It\u2019s worth a visit for hand-sewn, made-in-France espadrilles, plastic laminated Betty Boop shopping bags, and Che Guevara cigarette lighters. Perfect presents, and at bargain prices."
