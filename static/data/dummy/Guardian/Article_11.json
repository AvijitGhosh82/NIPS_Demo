Nigel Adkins\u2019 side had appeared to be cruising at Bramall Lane against their struggling visitors, taking a two-goal lead inside 61 minutes through Che Adams and Ryan Flynn. But goals from David Fox and Harry Davis turned things around and seemed to strike a near-fatal blow to the Blades\u2019 top-six hopes \u2013 before Billy Sharp scored three minutes from time to leave them with a four-point gap to make up over the next eight games.",

Colchester, who had won just once in their previous 23 league games, went a goal down to Doncaster debutant Gary McSheffrey but responded with four of their own in the final half-hour. Chris Porter, Elliot Lee, an Alex Gilbey screamer and Richard Brindley put the visitors to the sword \u2013 meaning that Colchester now lie eight points from safety, with a game in hand. \u201cThat victory is for the supporters,\u201d said their long-suffering manager Kevin Keen.",

Shrewsbury and Port Vale produced the same scoreline but there was rather more action at Rochdale, whose 4-1 dismissal of fellow play-off chasers Southend saw them leapfrog Phil Brown\u2019s side and move two points from sixth place. Jack Payne gave the Shrimpers a first-half lead at Spotland but Grant Holt, Joseph Rafferty, Jamie Allen and Joe Bunney replied in a mirror of events at Colchester. The heat is now on Barnsley, who occupy the final play-off place but could only draw 0-0 at home against Scunthorpe.",

Second-placed Oxford dropped two points, taking the lead against Stevenage through Liam Sercombe at the Kassam Stadium despite John Lundstram\u2019s early red card but seeing Byron Harrison equalise.

Hartlepool\u2019s win should, barring disaster, banish any remaining fears of relegation \u2013 a situation aided by York\u2019s 2-2 home draw with Crawley. Luke Summerfield, from the spot, and Michael Coulson brought York level after goals from Crawley\u2019s Matt Harrold and Liam McAlinden but Jackie McNamara\u2019s Minstermen remain seven points behind Stevenage and will need a superb late run to avoid the drop.",
