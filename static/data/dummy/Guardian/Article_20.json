They are bleary-eyed, and barely dressed, at least compared to the way they appear in photographs \u2013 they\u2019re not wearing anything made of satin and there\u2019s no hint of makeup \u2013 but, it has to be said, they still look pretty remarkable. Michael has turned up resplendent in a pair of half-mast flared jeans and a tight, midriff-baring T-shirt, his hair in the kind of lavishly be-mulletted feather cut that Rod Stewart used to sport when he was still in the Faces. That\u2019s quite a look you\u2019ve got there, I say."

It was like: \u2018OK, this is how I\u2019m dressing now.\u2019 Now it\u2019s hard for me to justify wearing something boring, because once you start, it\u2019s, like, weird.\u201d"

In the space of a year, they\u2019ve gone from playing New York\u2019s bars to signing a record deal with 4AD and have received praise from everyone from 60s psych heroes the Zombies to Questlove of the Roots. However, the fevered nature of that attention has led to their music \u2013 a heady, lavishly rococo brand of powerpop, bearing the influence of Harry Nilsson, Todd Rundgren, the Beatles and Broadway showtunes \u2013 being dismissed in some quarters as the work of hipster dilettantes. Some people who normally take artists inspired by revered figures such as Nilsson, Rundgren and Big Star very seriously indeed can\u2019t seem to get past how the Lemon Twigs look, assuming they\u2019re some kind of knowing joke."

And there was MOTP, or Members of the Press, a psychedelically inclined hard-rock outfit, inspired in equal parts by Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and a kids\u2019 TV show on Nickelodeon called The Naked Brothers Band, about \u2013 guess what? \u2013 an internationally famous rock band formed by tweenage brothers. \u201cWe wanted to be like a cool kid band,\u201d says Brian. \u201cLike, people would go not: \u2018Those kids play well for kids,\u2019 but, \u2018That\u2019s a really good band, but they\u2019re also really young.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible.

Michael starred alongside Michelle Pfeiffer and Olivia Wilde in the 2012 movie People Like Us: again, if you look on YouTube, you can find a clip of him being quizzed on the red carpet at the premiere, looking distinctly nonplussed and telling the interviewer he actually wants to be a musician. \u201cWe\u2019d get stuff because other people really wanted stuff and we didn\u2019t,\u201d says Brian, who winningly describes his time performing in Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway as \u201cjust singing really loud\u201d. \u201cWhen we were little kids, we got jobs because we didn\u2019t really want to do it in general, we wanted to do music. And most little kid actors would be very, very \u2018on\u2019 all the time \u2013 like, overly friendly and stuff \u2013 so when someone walks in and acts like they don\u2019t care, they stand out.

They put out a tape and were taken under the wing of Jonathan Rado, one half of Californian psych-pop duo Foxygen; their first gig was at a street fair near their home in Long Island and their second was supporting Foxygen at New York\u2019s 1,500-capacity Webster Hall. They found their sound gradually inclining toward the lushly melodic music in their dad\u2019s record collection, and their shows neatly dividing in two: Brian sings the first half, consisting of his songs, Michael emerging from behind the drum kit to sing his songs for the second half. Michael\u2019s stage presence in that second half has become increasingly augmented by his way with a high kick, which seem to appear during his performances with a startling frequency, not just one or two per song, but sometimes reaching a couple of dozen: \u201cI\u2019m not as good of a guitar player as he is and I get too insecure if I\u2019m not moving enough, and, I mean, kicks are just about the only thing you can do if you\u2019re playing a guitar while you\u2019re singing,\u201d he says."

It arrives positively teeming with melodies and ideas: the songs constantly shifting and changing as they go, as if the duo are trying to cram everything in. They\u2019ve talked about trying to pare things back a bit, they say, but with the best will in the world that idea doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s going too well: the follow-up is already written and is apparently rock opera-ish."
