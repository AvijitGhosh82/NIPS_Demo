implied not "inferred"
Nina Stibbes was given the last word in her woman's hour interview, following a listener's comments that au pairs were not members of the family they were working for and shouldn't expect to have the same experience as Stibbes had had. She just shouted "nonesense!" and the interview was left at that.  Thanks Nina. I wasn't the woman's hour commentator, but I am still traumatised by my experiences as an au pair for a rich family, over thirty years later. Lucky you for getting a good family, but don't for a moment imply that we all have the same experience. Think I'll give the film a swerve too.  Then there's the bumpkin form the East Midlands Schick too. I'm from Retford, and as it goes, I had heard of balsamic vinegar way back in the eighties. But that's another rant entirely. Good luck with the film: I'm not going to bother with it
Bumpkin from the East Midlands, bugger!
He was in a somewhat decent episode of Family Guy a few years ago which is an achievement in itself as Family Guy is nearly always terrible.
Having read and enjoyed the book I just don't see how you could dramatise it without AB and his caustic comments, whose idea was that? I was very keen to see it but now I'm not so sure but I'll probably give it a go in view of the quality of the cast.
Just guessing: BBC lawyers wrote to AB and MKW to get them to sign something, and they said no thanks? Dugdale could answer his own question by doing some actual journalism, you know like asking the press office or the agents.
