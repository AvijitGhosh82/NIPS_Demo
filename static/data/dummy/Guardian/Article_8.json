David \u2013 as his biographer calls him \u2013 went to Eton and Oxford, where he became fixated on Nazi Germany, rejecting his parents\u2019 \u201cappeasement\u201d. Later, he flirted with espionage, and inherited the editorship of the Observer, turning a newspaper renowned for John Bull conservatism into a pillar of the progressive postwar settlement. \u201cMy view,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the Observer should be run by liberal-minded people both of the left and the right.\u201d"

In \u201cold Observer\u201d style, Astor hired a young Patrick O\u2019Donovan on a whim; and appointed Terry Kilmartin literary editor in recognition of wartime comradeship."

Astor also commissioned several central European intellectuals (Arthur Koestler, EF Schumacher and Isaac Deutscher), whose weekly arguments he chaired \u201clike a wise and irritably confused old owl\u201d."

Jeremy Lewis, the seasoned biographer of Cyril Connolly and Penguin\u2019s Allen Lane, captures his subject\u2019s creative diffidence, a \u201cspecial way of smiling with his head on one side\u201d, but is rather defeated by his elusive inner steel. To those who cherish his memory, this will be no surprise."

        "text": "When I knew Astor, on the board of free-speech group Index on Censorship, he was an \u00e9minence grise. Tall, twinkly, soft-spoken and shy, he was at once a presence and an absence, punctuating discussions with sudden flashes of a laser intelligence. Despite a lifetime of psychoanalysis, he seemed an enigma to himself, who once confessed to his mother a \u201ccertain horror of intimacy\u201d."

Long after the strange death of liberal England, this child of privilege, who was said not to know about mortgages, articulated a tolerant humanity that reached worldwide."

He loved a cause, becoming the champion of both the Soil Association and, later, Myra Hindley."

In this milieu, his amateur creed was fully naturalised. For a generation, roughly 1948 to the early 1970s, his Observer came to embody a national conversation about the future of Britain."

Not only did he recognise George Orwell\u2019s genius, playing a crucial role in the completion of 1984, he also commissioned Vita Sackville-West, spotted Ken Tynan, Anthony Sampson and Katharine Whitehorn (who coined the phrase \u201cthe editor\u2019s indecision is final\u201d), as well as Michael Frayn and the photographer Jane Bown. Other names associated with his paper include Muriel Spark, Anthony Burgess and Clive James."

To some, his stand was treacherous and hysterical; to others, morally courageous and far-sighted. Typically, the Observer, without a Middle East reporter, had to dispatch its farming correspondent."

        "text": "After that high noon, a brasher professionalism in Fleet Street, symbolised by colour supplements, put the Observer on the defensive. Its trust was indifferent to profit. In a brutal competitive climate, its only capital was goodwill. But newspapers cannot survive on goodwill. After 1963, a bad year that began with the defection of its Beirut correspondent, Kim Philby, its decline was inexorable. In retrospect, it is the reporting on Mandela that stands out."

        "text": "Michael Frayn\u2019s novel Towards the End of the Morning probably marks the passing of Astor\u2019s Observer into myth. Until its sale in 1977, editor and newspaper were beleaguered. Once it was taken over by the Guardian Media Group in 1993 its future was protected. There have been many changes since, but Astor\u2019s ghost still hovers. For those who treasure the Observer and its ethos, and look back to a great editor whose journalistic DNA is buried deep in the marrow of today\u2019s edition, Jeremy Lewis has written a definitive account of Astor and his world."
