ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"“Your problem is that you’re not happy being sad…” When it comes to capturing the strange, romantic magic of making music, few modern film-makers are more on the money than John Carney. In his note-perfect 2007 drama Once, he gave us a beautifully unconsummated Dublin love story played out over the composition and recording of songs such as Falling Slowly, which went on to win an Academy award. In 2013’s underrated Begin Again, Keira Knightley played an adrift singer-songwriter who winds up recording her music to the backing of New York street sounds, spurred on by Mark Ruffalo’s formerly washed-up A&R man. Now Carney returns to Dublin and his youthful heyday of the mid-80s, where the delightful Sing Street spins its warm and uplifting fairytale, tugging at our melancholy heartstrings like a piece of classic bubblegum pop."

ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is Conor, a bedroom Bob Dylan struggling to turn the background noise of his parents’ collapsing marriage into songs. When his dad’s work hits the skids, Conor – later Cosmo – is sent to the Christian Brothers’ Synge Street school, where his private education manners (“Restaurant? You mean the canteen? You’re not in France now, you bleedin’ spanner!”) strike a bum note. Bullied by skinhead Barry, and smitten by mysterious outsider Raphina (Lucy Boynton), Conor decides that “we need to form a band”, and sets about rounding up local talent who can provide the perfect soundtrack to his VHS-era love story. “I’m a futurist!” declares Conor after conceding that John Taylor’s bass proficiency does indeed lend a funky edge to Duran Duran, a mantra he has learned from his stoner big brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who insists that, like the Pistols, “you need to learn how not to play – and that takes practise”."	Once was a perfect jewel of a film.	1
ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"The bittersweet, “happy sad” drama that follows has drawn inevitable, if misguided, comparisons with The Commitments, yet tonally this is closer to the teen spirit of Todd Graff’s 2009 film Bandslam (to which David Bowie lent an approving cameo) or even Richard Linklater’s sublime School of Rock. As Carney has proved previously, he knows how to straddle the line between the sound in the room and the sound in your head – a sequence that segues from bedroom composition to living room rehearsal (with tea and biscuits) to full studio production perfectly negotiates the space between kitchen-sink realism and musical fantasy in which this lovely, lyrical movie casts its spell."	Once was a perfect jewel of a film.	1
ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"There’s a touch of Michel Gondry’s Be Kind Rewind or Garth Jennings’s Son of Rambow in the band’s attempts to reproduce the high-gloss sheen of Russell Mulcahy’s pop videos in a Dublin backstreet, armed only with a silk scarf, a cowboy outfit and an abundance of eyeliner. As the film progresses, the videos become more ambitious, mutating into a dreamscape reminiscent of Back to the Future’s climactic prom, setting the tone for Sing Street’s own fabulist finale."	Once was a perfect jewel of a film.	1
ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"But it’s the fact that Carney wisely keeps one foot on the ground that gives the film its emotional heft. Having served time in the Frames, Carney understands the practicalities of writing, rehearsing and performing pop songs. Here, he enlists former Danny Wilson frontman Gary Clark to (co-)write original material inspired by Conor’s ever-changing playlist, from the Cure to the Jam, Joe Jackson, Spandau Ballet and beyond. Reminding us that most great pop songs are written by channelling existing hits, Drive it Like You Stole It neatly echoes the triplet bass riff from Hall & Oates’s already derivative Maneater to finger-popping effect, while the band’s dress sense changes with the winds of the latest Top of the Pops (some chronological liberties notwithstanding)."	Once was a perfect jewel of a film.	1
ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"Providing the backbone – both musical and fraternal – for Conor’s education is Reynor’s affectionately observed Brendan, his lost dreams and rich experience fuelling his younger brother’s rite of passage. Typical of Carney, too, to lend a gentle ear to even the most seemingly unsympathetic characters, with Barry’s bullying behaviour contextualised as a product of his own battered horizons."

With its inclusive 12A certificate, Sing Street should strike a chord not only with those ageing 80s nostalgists underwhelmed by the locker room Americana of Everybody Wants Some!!, but also with tween audiences who have long outgrown their Camp Rock DVDs and are ready for a little more grit amid the glitter. Happy sad indeed. I laughed, I cried, I bought the soundtrack album."	Once was a perfect jewel of a film.	1

When his dad’s work hits the skids, Conor – later Cosmo – is sent to the Christian Brothers’ Synge Street school, where his private education manners (“Restaurant? You mean the canteen? You’re not in France now, you bleedin’ spanner!”) strike a bum note. Bullied by skinhead Barry, and smitten by mysterious outsider Raphina (Lucy Boynton), Conor decides that “we need to form a band”, and sets about rounding up local talent who can provide the perfect soundtrack to his VHS-era love story. “I’m a futurist!” declares Conor after conceding that John Taylor’s bass proficiency does indeed lend a funky edge to Duran Duran, a mantra he has learned from his stoner big brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who insists that, like the Pistols, “you need to learn how not to play – and that takes practise”."

ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"The bittersweet, “happy sad” drama that follows has drawn inevitable, if misguided, comparisons with The Commitments, yet tonally this is closer to the teen spirit of Todd Graff’s 2009 film Bandslam (to which David Bowie lent an approving cameo) or even Richard Linklater’s sublime School of Rock. As Carney has proved previously, he knows how to straddle the line between the sound in the room and the sound in your head – a sequence that segues from bedroom composition to living room rehearsal (with tea and biscuits) to full studio production perfectly negotiates the space between kitchen-sink realism and musical fantasy in which this lovely, lyrical movie casts its spell."

ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"But it’s the fact that Carney wisely keeps one foot on the ground that gives the film its emotional heft. Having served time in the Frames, Carney understands the practicalities of writing, rehearsing and performing pop songs. Here, he enlists former Danny Wilson frontman Gary Clark to (co-)write original material inspired by Conor’s ever-changing playlist, from the Cure to the Jam, Joe Jackson, Spandau Ballet and beyond. Reminding us that most great pop songs are written by channelling existing hits, Drive it Like You Stole It neatly echoes the triplet bass riff from Hall & Oates’s already derivative Maneater to finger-popping effect, while the band’s dress sense changes with the winds of the latest Top of the Pops (some chronological liberties notwithstanding)."

ArticleStory_77	Sing Street review – pop goes the playground	"“Your problem is that you’re not happy being sad…” When it comes to capturing the strange, romantic magic of making music, few modern film-makers are more on the money than John Carney. In his note-perfect 2007 drama Once, he gave us a beautifully unconsummated Dublin love story played out over the composition and recording of songs such as Falling Slowly, which went on to win an Academy award. In 2013’s underrated Begin Again, Keira Knightley played an adrift singer-songwriter who winds up recording her music to the backing of New York street sounds, spurred on by Mark Ruffalo’s formerly washed-up A&R man. Now Carney returns to Dublin and his youthful heyday of the mid-80s, where the delightful Sing Street spins its warm and uplifting fairytale, tugging at our melancholy heartstrings like a piece of classic bubblegum pop."	"Yes, very enjoyable film and surprisingly moving in places. There's a lot more to it than just the trailer."	4

Second-placed Oxford dropped two points, taking the lead against Stevenage through Liam Sercombe at the Kassam Stadium despite John Lundstram’s early red card but seeing Byron Harrison equalise. Harrison’s goal arrested a five-game losing streak for Stevenage, who appointed Glenn Roeder as managerial assistant this week."

That means Orient drop out of the play-off places; Wycombe’s 1-0 defeat of Mansfield, achieved through Michael Harriman’s second-half winner, means the Chairboys sit a point clear in seventh position and three behind Portsmouth, who hammered Notts County 4-0."

Hartlepool’s win should, barring disaster, banish any remaining fears of relegation – a situation aided by York’s 2-2 home draw with Crawley. Luke Summerfield, from the spot, and Michael Coulson brought York level after goals from Crawley’s Matt Harrold and Liam McAlinden but Jackie McNamara’s Minstermen remain seven points behind Stevenage and will need a superb late run to avoid the drop."

ArticleStory_333	David Astor by Jeremy Lewis review – definitive life of a Fleet Street great	"After that high noon, a brasher professionalism in Fleet Street, symbolised by colour supplements, put the Observer on the defensive. Its trust was indifferent to profit. In a brutal competitive climate, its only capital was goodwill. But newspapers cannot survive on goodwill. After 1963, a bad year that began with the defection of its Beirut correspondent, Kim Philby, its decline was inexorable. In retrospect, it is the reporting on Mandela that stands out."

Until its sale in 1977, editor and newspaper were beleaguered. Once it was taken over by the Guardian Media Group in 1993 its future was protected. There have been many changes since, but Astor’s ghost still hovers.

ArticleStory_333	David Astor by Jeremy Lewis review – definitive life of a Fleet Street great	"David Astor was the last of the great English amateurs, that kind of intangible, charming one-off who make this culture and society both fascinating and inexplicable. To his admirers, he was a good man in Fleet Street; to his opponents, he was a sanctimonious, spoilt liberal."	"A review by a guy of a book by a guy about a guy.

ArticleStory_333	David Astor by Jeremy Lewis review – definitive life of a Fleet Street great	"His family were millionaires; Joyce Grenfell a cousin; and his mother, Nancy, an impossible Virginian aristocrat, with whom he fought all his life. David – as his biographer calls him – went to Eton and Oxford, where he became fixated on Nazi Germany, rejecting his parents’ “appeasement”. Later, he flirted with espionage, and inherited the editorship of the Observer, turning a newspaper renowned for John Bull conservatism into a pillar of the progressive postwar settlement. “My view,” he said, “is that the Observer should be run by liberal-minded people both of the left and the right.”"	"A review by a guy of a book by a guy about a guy.

Then there's the bumpkin form the East Midlands Schick too. I'm from Retford, and as it goes, I had heard of balsamic vinegar way back in the eighties. But that's another rant entirely. Good luck with the film: I'm not going to bother with it"	4

ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"People tend to be snobby about Christmas, and they tend to be particularly snobby about the cultural things it produces: the overly commercialised songs, movies and TV ads. The excess and sentimentality of it, the inclusive, populist spirit, seem designed to bring out the Ebenezer Scrooge in even the most uncommitted of cultural snobs."	"'One of my favourite things about Christmas is definitely the carols, especially O Holy Night and In the Bleak Midwinter.' Agreed. 'The Holly and the Ivy' is another."	2
ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"I will never join them. Yes, I know Christmas can be a pain. When I was suffering from serious depression, the whole season became a tormenting joke, my own misery highlighted by the contrast with the jollity of my surroundings. But Christmas was also one of the things that helped get me out of that depression. It helped as a marker of progress, since it was always easier to remember Christmases in a way that you can’t remember, say, Octobers."	"'One of my favourite things about Christmas is definitely the carols, especially O Holy Night and In the Bleak Midwinter.' Agreed. 'The Holly and the Ivy' is another."	2
ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"And, for not particularly religious people – people like me – who veer between being atheist, agnostic and vaguely “spiritual” (depending on the day of the week and the level of hangover), the essence of Christmas generally isn’t found in a church, but rather on a screen or a stage or in the pages of a novel. Because, ever since 1843, when Dickens published A Christmas Carol, there has been a new kind of Christmas, a parallel Christmas that defined it as a feeling, rather than a date or a biblical narrative. Pinning down that feeling is hard, since it is a magical feeling, and magic can’t be explained. It is – as Dickens’s Scrooge suggests when he says: “I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year” – beyond the season itself."	"'One of my favourite things about Christmas is definitely the carols, especially O Holy Night and In the Bleak Midwinter.' Agreed. 'The Holly and the Ivy' is another."	2
ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"So, I would like to defend Christmas against the Christmas snobs. We need the collective bonhomie it can inspire, especially in 2016, this terrible joke of a year. And I would like to defend it, too, against the people who frown at the commercialisation or secularisation of the festival. I have only ever known Christmas as a commercialised, secularised affair, and yet I have still found magic and inspiration in it. I always have."	"'One of my favourite things about Christmas is definitely the carols, especially O Holy Night and In the Bleak Midwinter.' Agreed. 'The Holly and the Ivy' is another."	2
ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"When I was growing up, in the 80s, the supreme pre-Christmas highlight was the day the new Radio Times came out. Along with millions of other semi-losers, I would rush out to WH Smith to buy the two-week bumper issue, weighty with promise. Then I would rush home to study the listings like a monk reading psalms, carefully highlighting everything I was going to watch."	"'One of my favourite things about Christmas is definitely the carols, especially O Holy Night and In the Bleak Midwinter.' Agreed. 'The Holly and the Ivy' is another."	2
ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"I wasn’t always a happy child, but I was always happy at Christmas.

I loved it, because it was very immersive – and I got to dance on stage with Brenda Blethyn – but it was in books that I found the most Christmas magic. Not only A Christmas Carol, which I finally read when I was about 12, but also in tales such as The Snowman, Susan Cooper’s The Dark is Rising sequence and Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Match Girl.

My parents would take me to the theatre in Sheffield and Leeds on Boxing Day. When I had my own children, I always took them and they absolutely loved it. What I think is so interesting about panto is that it gets children into the theatre. It’s live, the actors are there in front of you - it doesn’t involve a phone or a computer. As a little girl, I adored Cinderella, and I remember seeing this girl’s rags transform into the most glamorous dress. Being practically minded, though, I was always conscious of her glass slippers and thought that they must be really uncomfortable.

It was too extreme a departure from the usual turkey or chicken and I had to protest, so they presented me with a whole capon – a castrated male chicken that has achieved a level of plumpness no chicken should ever achieve.

And what better than Bach to clear the palate? The disciplined notes, the soaring, perfect structure of the music reminds us what this season is all about: kindness to others and healing. So, a firm date in my Christmas diary is the annual performance by Ludus Baroque of Bach’s Christmas Oratorio. Ludus Baroque is one of the finest chamber orchestras and choirs in the UK and is conducted by a friend, Richard Neville-Towle, who gathers the best baroque singers and instrumentalists and brings them to Canongate church in Edinburgh. It is a perfect setting for Bach: steeped in history, beautiful in the simple, unpretentious way of Scottish architecture of the time. Bach sounds perfect there, and at the end we will go out into the night, perhaps reminding ourselves that the following day, the winter solstice, things get lighter – and better, we hope."

By the time I was 10 I was starting to have solos. Going to midnight mass is still the most important part of Christmas for me. There were months and months of practice, so nerves were pretty high.

So, our Christmas involved my father dressing up as a woman. I have powerful memories of hanging up the big white-and-red stockings Dad had worn on stage. I always loved going backstage to his dressing room and meeting everyone. My godmother was a field mouse to his toad. As an ancient historian, I know we are creatures of memory and need habit and ritual. Despite this, physiologically, our brains crave disturbance. A panto has familiarity, but it also presents the audience with things they don’t normally experience.

Because, ever since 1843, when Dickens published A Christmas Carol, there has been a new kind of Christmas, a parallel Christmas that defined it as a feeling, rather than a date or a biblical narrative. Pinning down that feeling is hard, since it is a magical feeling, and magic can’t be explained. It is – as Dickens’s Scrooge suggests when he says: “I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year” – beyond the season itself."

Because, ever since 1843, when Dickens published A Christmas Carol, there has been a new kind of Christmas, a parallel Christmas that defined it as a feeling, rather than a date or a biblical narrative. Pinning down that feeling is hard, since it is a magical feeling, and magic can’t be explained.

Only ET had had such a profound, positive psychological effect on me. The scene near the end in which Scrooge dresses up as Father Christmas and delivers turkey and toys to the Cratchits worked on me like a kind of emotional central heating; the song Thank You Very Much was so unabashedly happy and sentimental that it reminded me of the child I was. It was one of the most moving experiences of my life and – don’t laugh – I think it made me a better person.

My mother went to the theatre a lot and used to drag me to see Henrik Ibsen plays when I really wanted to be at home watching Beverly Hills Cop. But then, at Christmas time in 1985, she took me to the National Theatre to see The Nativity, one of Tony Harrison’s famous reinventions of medieval mystery plays. I loved it, because it was very immersive – and I got to dance on stage with Brenda Blethyn – but it was in books that I found the most Christmas magic. Not only A Christmas Carol, which I finally read when I was about 12, but also in tales such as The Snowman, Susan Cooper’s The Dark is Rising sequence and Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Match Girl. All have a darkness to them, as do all the great Christmas stories. In The Little Match Girl, the saddest of all Christmas tales, a poor, homeless girl lights matches to keep herself warm and sees visions of Christmas in the flame. The power of a Christmas story, like the power of Christmas itself, acts like that light in the dark."	Carols from Kings is a very special part of Christmas.

What I think is so interesting about panto is that it gets children into the theatre. It’s live, the actors are there in front of you - it doesn’t involve a phone or a computer. As a little girl, I adored Cinderella, and I remember seeing this girl’s rags transform into the most glamorous dress. Being practically minded, though, I was always conscious of her glass slippers and thought that they must be really uncomfortable.

I pretended to, because everyone else seemed to, even my younger sister. But a part of me never quite stopped believing. Around that time, I remember walking my springer spaniel, Murdoch, in the park and thinking that molecules of Christmas magic hovered in the air. It was something you could feel.

I was gripped by the then unfamiliar story of a rich old miser who, after seeing three Christmas spirits, changes his ways on Christmas morning. Only ET had had such a profound, positive psychological effect on me. The scene near the end in which Scrooge dresses up as Father Christmas and delivers turkey and toys to the Cratchits worked on me like a kind of emotional central heating; the song Thank You Very Much was so unabashedly happy and sentimental that it reminded me of the child I was. It was one of the most moving experiences of my life and – don’t laugh – I think it made me a better person. It helped me to understand the age-old festive lesson that giving presents makes you happier than receiving them."	"Matt's account is superb - humane, insightful and for me also, deeply true.

ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"It wasn’t just films, either. My mother went to the theatre a lot and used to drag me to see Henrik Ibsen plays when I really wanted to be at home watching Beverly Hills Cop. But then, at Christmas time in 1985, she took me to the National Theatre to see The Nativity, one of Tony Harrison’s famous reinventions of medieval mystery plays. I loved it, because it was very immersive – and I got to dance on stage with Brenda Blethyn – but it was in books that I found the most Christmas magic. Not only A Christmas Carol, which I finally read when I was about 12, but also in tales such as The Snowman, Susan Cooper’s The Dark is Rising sequence and Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Match Girl. All have a darkness to them, as do all the great Christmas stories. In The Little Match Girl, the saddest of all Christmas tales, a poor, homeless girl lights matches to keep herself warm and sees visions of Christmas in the flame. The power of a Christmas story, like the power of Christmas itself, acts like that light in the dark."	"Matt's account is superb - humane, insightful and for me also, deeply true.

My parents would take me to the theatre in Sheffield and Leeds on Boxing Day. When I had my own children, I always took them and they absolutely loved it. What I think is so interesting about panto is that it gets children into the theatre. It’s live, the actors are there in front of you - it doesn’t involve a phone or a computer. As a little girl, I adored Cinderella, and I remember seeing this girl’s rags transform into the most glamorous dress. Being practically minded, though, I was always conscious of her glass slippers and thought that they must be really uncomfortable. Christmas is always a precious time when my rather small family gets together, and what is lovely is that it is just the four of us. The boys, who are 33 and 29, still expect pillowcases as stockings, although they have become incredibly good cooks and so often take over from me. We always take the dogs for a walk and then we flop in front of the telly. Morecambe and Wise used to dominate Christmas when I was younger, but now we watch whatever is good – or bad. I can’t wait."

And what better than Bach to clear the palate? The disciplined notes, the soaring, perfect structure of the music reminds us what this season is all about: kindness to others and healing. So, a firm date in my Christmas diary is the annual performance by Ludus Baroque of Bach’s Christmas Oratorio. Ludus Baroque is one of the finest chamber orchestras and choirs in the UK and is conducted by a friend, Richard Neville-Towle, who gathers the best baroque singers and instrumentalists and brings them to Canongate church in Edinburgh. It is a perfect setting for Bach: steeped in history, beautiful in the simple, unpretentious way of Scottish architecture of the time. Bach sounds perfect there, and at the end we will go out into the night, perhaps reminding ourselves that the following day, the winter solstice, things get lighter – and better, we hope."

That is what theatre is about: the unexpected. My husband used to run circuses and sometimes has his circus friends over for Christmas dinner.

When I was suffering from serious depression, the whole season became a tormenting joke, my own misery highlighted by the contrast with the jollity of my surroundings. But Christmas was also one of the things that helped get me out of that depression. It helped as a marker of progress, since it was always easier to remember Christmases in a way that you can’t remember, say, Octobers."	matt haig - u R christmas - wonderful stuff(ing)	4
ArticleStory_322	Matt Haig on Christmas: ‘It was an anchor at the bottom of the year. It fixed my childhood in place’	"And, for not particularly religious people – people like me – who veer between being atheist, agnostic and vaguely “spiritual” (depending on the day of the week and the level of hangover), the essence of Christmas generally isn’t found in a church, but rather on a screen or a stage or in the pages of a novel. Because, ever since 1843, when Dickens published A Christmas Carol, there has been a new kind of Christmas, a parallel Christmas that defined it as a feeling, rather than a date or a biblical narrative. Pinning down that feeling is hard, since it is a magical feeling, and magic can’t be explained. It is – as Dickens’s Scrooge suggests when he says: “I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year” – beyond the season itself."	matt haig - u R christmas - wonderful stuff(ing)	4

Our big thing is to try and fit as many people around the table as possible.	matt haig - u R christmas - wonderful stuff(ing)	1

They put out a tape and were taken under the wing of Jonathan Rado, one half of Californian psych-pop duo Foxygen; their first gig was at a street fair near their home in Long Island and their second was supporting Foxygen at New York’s 1,500-capacity Webster Hall. They found their sound gradually inclining toward the lushly melodic music in their dad’s record collection, and their shows neatly dividing in two: Brian sings the first half, consisting of his songs, Michael emerging from behind the drum kit to sing his songs for the second half. Michael’s stage presence in that second half has become increasingly augmented by his way with a high kick, which seem to appear during his performances with a startling frequency, not just one or two per song, but sometimes reaching a couple of dozen: “I’m not as good of a guitar player as he is and I get too insecure if I’m not moving enough, and, I mean, kicks are just about the only thing you can do if you’re playing a guitar while you’re singing,” he says."

They are bleary-eyed, and barely dressed, at least compared to the way they appear in photographs – they’re not wearing anything made of satin and there’s no hint of makeup – but, it has to be said, they still look pretty remarkable. Michael has turned up resplendent in a pair of half-mast flared jeans and a tight, midriff-baring T-shirt, his hair in the kind of lavishly be-mulletted feather cut that Rod Stewart used to sport when he was still in the Faces.

They are bleary-eyed, and barely dressed, at least compared to the way they appear in photographs – they’re not wearing anything made of satin and there’s no hint of makeup – but, it has to be said, they still look pretty remarkable. Michael has turned up resplendent in a pair of half-mast flared jeans and a tight, midriff-baring T-shirt, his hair in the kind of lavishly be-mulletted feather cut that Rod Stewart used to sport when he was still in the Faces. That’s quite a look you’ve got there, I say."	"I'm normally very suspicious of young bands doing something like this.

They put out a tape and were taken under the wing of Jonathan Rado, one half of Californian psych-pop duo Foxygen; their first gig was at a street fair near their home in Long Island and their second was supporting Foxygen at New York’s 1,500-capacity Webster Hall. They found their sound gradually inclining toward the lushly melodic music in their dad’s record collection, and their shows neatly dividing in two: Brian sings the first half, consisting of his songs, Michael emerging from behind the drum kit to sing his songs for the second half. Michael’s stage presence in that second half has become increasingly augmented by his way with a high kick, which seem to appear during his performances with a startling frequency, not just one or two per song, but sometimes reaching a couple of dozen: “I’m not as good of a guitar player as he is and I get too insecure if I’m not moving enough, and, I mean, kicks are just about the only thing you can do if you’re playing a guitar while you’re singing,” he says."

Straight arrow Toby (Chris Pine) and ex-con loose cannon Tanner (Ben Foster) stage a series of heists against various branches of the bank, all the while pursued by Jeff Bridges, on deliciously crusty form as a Texas ranger nearing the end of his career. Part heist, part western for the Occupy generation, this sharply plotted thriller is a triumph for both director David Mackenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario).

ArticleStory_47	Hell Or High Water review – sharp western for the Occupy generation	"A pair of estranged Texan brothers are reunited against a common foe – the bank that gypped their father into signing away the family farm and now threatens to foreclose on the loan. Straight arrow Toby (Chris Pine) and ex-con loose cannon Tanner (Ben Foster) stage a series of heists against various branches of the bank, all the while pursued by Jeff Bridges, on deliciously crusty form as a Texas ranger nearing the end of his career. Part heist, part western for the Occupy generation, this sharply plotted thriller is a triumph for both director David Mackenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario). Mackenzie makes effective use of the hard-baked Texas landscape, which seems to consist entirely of grit and grudges. And Sheridan’s acidic humour brings a spiky levity to some scenes – a ferociously charmless waitress in a steak restaurant is a particular high point."	Excellent film!	4

ArticleStory_527	The Secret Life of Pets review – hyperactive with furry laughter	"Toy Story has been rewritten for pets in this family animation, packed with quirkily voiced characters of all shapes and sizes, frenetically hyperactive, and crammed with detail in the traditional manner – plenty of swooning images of New York that appear to belong to a more romcom-type of film. Just as pet owners wonder what their pets do all day while they’re out, pets are baffled as to what their human masters and mistresses find to occupy themselves with during this mysterious time of “work”. Max (voiced by Louis CK) is a terrier who is outraged when his owner brings home a new rescue dog that he must now live with: Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet). At first mortal enemies, they become pals when they find themselves collarless and menaced by strays. It’s not ground-breaking, but there are laughs, and it is a good audience movie."	I saw the trailer for this before another film and it was hilarious. My friends and I agreed that we must see it. Might look a bit odd though all adults going to see this film with no kids.	4

I came across her albums in France and she absolutely blew my mind. I gave her her first UK airplay on 6 Music in 2014, which I’m very proud about. It’s great now that she’s hit the big time. When I saw her live, I thought this is like nothing I’ve ever seen: contemporary dance mixed with a big light show. It’s an entire artistic vision. It’s not sequenced and showbiz style – there are no sequins. It’s different from what you’d expect from a pop star.

The first two-thirds are classical ballet, so pretty and lovely, then at the end, when Anastasia is in a mental institution, there’s German expressionist modern dance.

It was then taken up by others – Khoikhoi herders and later farmworkers in the region. There are Nama Riel dancing groups all over the Northern Cape these days, participating in cultural festivals and performing in their home towns at the weekend. Because dances are traditionally held on deep sand and involve swift kicking motions, the locals say it’s a good Nama Riel if “the dust rises before you”. The riel almost disappeared for decades, but is now enjoying a massive revival, and they’re starting to teach it in the schools of Williston. The community has incredible pride in the dance.

Four years ago the first Philipstown Wire Car Grand Prix was held, which sees the community’s young people go on a mad dash through the village streets.

Middelpos is one of the tiniest settlements in the Karoo, made famous by the great UK-based (but South African born) actor Antony Sher in his book, Middelpost. The church bazaar is in September and it’s held in the street. We go down there to support all the stalls selling regional cheeses, meat and biltong.

When it began in 2007, barely 1,000 people came – now there’s a 2016 attendance cap of 11,700 tickets. It’s the most vibey, peaceful mass collection of celebrating South Africans you’ll find. People go there to be creative and have fun – it’s a temporary city of art, theme camps, costume, music and performance. It culminates with the night-burning of various giant artworks but really ends with the Moop (matter out of place) patrol, where hundreds of people pick up every last trace of human detritus, leaving the festival grounds as clean as they found them."

Whenever anything is written about the Art Brut movement, the Owl House of Nieu Bethesda is mentioned. Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha. Playwright Athol Fugard’s play and subsequent film, The Road to Mecca, was based on the life and work of Helen Martins. Today, the Owl House is a museum."

Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

The threat of fracking and uranium mining in the region has evoked new ways of expression, and a degree of urgency to save it.

ArticleStory_1313	"The alternative guide to the Karoo, South Africa"	"The town of Nieu Bethesda, where I live, rose to fame because of a very eccentric woman called Helen Martins who was an outsider artist. Whenever anything is written about the Art Brut movement, the Owl House of Nieu Bethesda is mentioned. Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha. Playwright Athol Fugard’s play and subsequent film, The Road to Mecca, was based on the life and work of Helen Martins. Today, the Owl House is a museum."

ArticleStory_1313	"The alternative guide to the Karoo, South Africa"	"For artists, the Karoo is an incredible place. For example, my neighbour Annette van der Hulst, who is a seamstress, once asked someone for a kudu horn. People got to hear of this, so soon she had a long stream of people bringing her kudu and cow horns. Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing. You’d never get that happening in a city. The Karoo forces you to see and use what is around you."	Just pray the frackers are kept away from this beautiful region.	3

There’s an amazing series of lino-cuts that depict the Karoo under threat of fracking – it tells the story beautifully. The threat of fracking and uranium mining in the region has evoked new ways of expression, and a degree of urgency to save it. There have been quite a few exhibitions on the subject, the prime one being Fear & Loss, which has been moving around the country, and which looks at the interplay of heritage, culture, politics and economics and the way all of this impacts on the land and the communities who live on it."

Playwright Athol Fugard’s play and subsequent film, The Road to Mecca, was based on the life and work of Helen Martins. Today, the Owl House is a museum."

For example, my neighbour Annette van der Hulst, who is a seamstress, once asked someone for a kudu horn. People got to hear of this, so soon she had a long stream of people bringing her kudu and cow horns. Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing. You’d never get that happening in a city. The Karoo forces you to see and use what is around you."	"I love the Karoo, and the 'Back Garden' route through the Klein Karoo is awesome.

Because dances are traditionally held on deep sand and involve swift kicking motions, the locals say it’s a good Nama Riel if “the dust rises before you”.

Whenever anything is written about the Art Brut movement, the Owl House of Nieu Bethesda is mentioned. Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha.

Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

The threat of fracking and uranium mining in the region has evoked new ways of expression, and a degree of urgency to save it.

We all live in Prince Albert, which is on the very edge of the Swartberg, which is a micro-biosphere with numbers of unique plants and a huge range of fauna. Between Prince Albert and Oudtshoorn lie two routes – the pass over the mountains, and the Meiringspoort pass which follows the winding path of the river between spectacular, lichen covered red mountains, and past a waterfall which fills the lake below, believed for many years to be the home of a mermaid. On the way, one may see baboons, mongoose, leopard tortoises, small gazelles and, between dusk and early morning, the beautiful kudu antelope.MrsSpinster"	Nice to see they included a photograph of a Climax.	1

A vast, ancient seabed straddling the midriff of the country, the Karoo (a Bushman word for “dry place”) is the size of Germany. In the past two centuries, more than 100 towns, villages, settlements and railway sidings have sprung up in the region, but the population has always been sparse, never topping the one-million mark."

You also keep referring to as a desert, which it is not. It is considered semi-desert, and some areas, especially in the Klein Karoo, actually get quite a bit of rain. Also, you dismally fail to mention the threat of fracking. Yes... that scourge is threatening the Karoo. Fracking requires a lot of water, which there isn't in the Karoo.

Self-catering places in Graaff-Reinet normally come complete with outside braai facilities, so you can make dinner the adventure of the day: hunt down the local butcher, ask for good lamb chops. You will probably find that the meat comes from a farm nearby, and the town has its own recipe for sosaties – lamb or beef kebabs usually marinated in lightly curried sweet and sour sauce. Let them advise you on how to cook them, then gather up something to drink at the Drostdy Hotel wine shop, perhaps one of the Rupert labels like the 2013 Terra del Capo Arne, a juicy red.

Whenever anything is written about the Art Brut movement, the Owl House of Nieu Bethesda is mentioned. Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha. Playwright Athol Fugard’s play and subsequent film, The Road to Mecca, was based on the life and work of Helen Martins. Today, the Owl House is a museum."

Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

For example, my neighbour Annette van der Hulst, who is a seamstress, once asked someone for a kudu horn. People got to hear of this, so soon she had a long stream of people bringing her kudu and cow horns. Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha.

Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

The threat of fracking and uranium mining in the region has evoked new ways of expression, and a degree of urgency to save it.

On a stroll, you may discover fossils, Bushmen arrowheads, settler coat buttons and spent cartridges from a Boer War skirmish. It has been scored by the passage of millions of springbok on their migrations across the plains, devouring all before them.

There are Nama Riel dancing groups all over the Northern Cape these days, participating in cultural festivals and performing in their home towns at the weekend. Because dances are traditionally held on deep sand and involve swift kicking motions, the locals say it’s a good Nama Riel if “the dust rises before you”. The riel almost disappeared for decades, but is now enjoying a massive revival, and they’re starting to teach it in the schools of Williston. The community has incredible pride in the dance.

Whenever anything is written about the Art Brut movement, the Owl House of Nieu Bethesda is mentioned. Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha. Playwright Athol Fugard’s play and subsequent film, The Road to Mecca, was based on the life and work of Helen Martins. Today, the Owl House is a museum."	"The stars, oh man the stars.

Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

The threat of fracking and uranium mining in the region has evoked new ways of expression, and a degree of urgency to save it.

Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha.

Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

It was then taken up by others – Khoikhoi herders and later farmworkers in the region. There are Nama Riel dancing groups all over the Northern Cape these days, participating in cultural festivals and performing in their home towns at the weekend. Because dances are traditionally held on deep sand and involve swift kicking motions, the locals say it’s a good Nama Riel if “the dust rises before you”. The riel almost disappeared for decades, but is now enjoying a massive revival, and they’re starting to teach it in the schools of Williston. The community has incredible pride in the dance.

Whenever anything is written about the Art Brut movement, the Owl House of Nieu Bethesda is mentioned. Back in the 1960s, Helen turned her family home into what would become the outsider art centre of the Karoo, and a great tourist attraction for Nieu Bethesda. With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha. Playwright Athol Fugard’s play and subsequent film, The Road to Mecca, was based on the life and work of Helen Martins. Today, the Owl House is a museum."	is this South africa of 20 years ago? the only black people to feature in the article are (in photos) dancers performing for the tourists and assistants at stores/braais.

For example, my neighbour Annette van der Hulst, who is a seamstress, once asked someone for a kudu horn.

Eventually, she worked out a way of putting an appliqué (needlework technique) of Shweshwe (a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional clothing) and other scraps of cloth on them – sort of a fusion modern art kind of thing.

The threat of fracking and uranium mining in the region has evoked new ways of expression, and a degree of urgency to save it.

There are Nama Riel dancing groups all over the Northern Cape these days, participating in cultural festivals and performing in their home towns at the weekend. Because dances are traditionally held on deep sand and involve swift kicking motions, the locals say it’s a good Nama Riel if “the dust rises before you”.

With her craftsman-assistant, Koos Malgas, she worked in cement and glass, building an imaginarium that drew from all religions and told many stories – the Three Wise Men, something from Omar Khayyam, in the corner stands an all-seeing owl and there’s a cross-legged Buddha.
