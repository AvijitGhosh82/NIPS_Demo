I made them with Saturn peaches, those amusing flat peaches that look like the rings of Saturn (or like bagels; they are also known as doughnut peaches). The doughnuts are fun to work with and delicious, even if, admittedly, they are higher in sugar than what you might expect from me."

I coat mine with a mix of ground almonds and raw brown sugar, sear them in butter and set them on a lime-inflected raspberry sauce. Its a match made in heaven. Vanilla ice cream is welcome, though not required."

        "text": "Peeling Saturn peaches is not usually necessary, but the ground almonds adhere to the peaches better if the flesh is exposed. After blanching, the skin can still be difficult to remove, especially if the peaches are not perfectly ripe. But even if it does not come off neatly, you will be hiding the surface with the ground almond mixture."
