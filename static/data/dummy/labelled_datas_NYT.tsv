https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/dining/doughnut-saturn-peach-dessert.html	A Doughnut Thats a Peach	"Finally, doughnuts in the Recipes for Health column! Mind you, they are pure fruit. I made them with Saturn peaches, those amusing flat peaches that look like the rings of Saturn (or like bagels; they are also known as doughnut peaches). The doughnuts are fun to work with and delicious, even if, admittedly, they are higher in sugar than what you might expect from me."	"Delicious. This is one word that comes to my mind when I think of my favorite fruit: peaches. I have many memories with the fruit, peaches. In this article I was practically drooling over how delicious these peach doughnuts sounded. I have many memories of my most favorite fruit, but one is when my neighbors brought over some peaches from their familys peach farm. These peaches were amazing! They were juicy, soft, and delicious. The peaches themselves even looked as they tasted. They were a vibrant coral-orange and were the perfect peach shape. Another wonderful memory I have of the delicious fruit is when my dad cooked my family a special dessert. My dad spent at least 2 hours cooking this delectable dessert. He made an exquisite caramel sauce that just melted in your mouth. And he grilled to peaches. The peaches flesh was so ripe. It was so juicy that my mouth nearly flooded with the freshly grilled peach. That was the best dessert that I had ever had and I will never forget the experience and how tasty it was. My last memory with peaches is when my family went peach picking. This was such a fun thing to do because we got to pick our own peaches, and just like apple picking, eat the peaches too! After we picked the peaches, we went home and made an amazing peach pie. I had never had peach pie before then so I was so excited to try it. This article was great because it reminded me of how many memories I have with my favorite fruits!"	3

These are inspired by a baked pistachio-encrusted Saturn peach doughnut I learned to make from the pastry chef Sherry Yard.

Centuries of artists and writers and philosophers who have praised boredom (and its genteel cousin, idleness) were probably not simply conspiring to justify lying around on a sofa for more hours than seem obviously necessary. (Though, maybe.) Boredom is a kind of meditation. To be bored is, for a spell, to not let the noise out there get in. Which is also a way of letting something happen in the meager, but essential, in here. To never be bored would be to never be prompted to rupture the boredom. So even as boredom is a kind of failure of perception, it also restores perception. Harry was always Harry, but his family could no longer see that. He started to do all his old, clever tricks.

We see this with Viola and Sebastian in Shakespeares Twelfth Night, with Joseph in the Bible story of his coat of many colors. The recognition, in these stories, is also a kind of resurrection. In boredom, it is the world that had appeared to be dead and that reveals itself as new, as miraculously returned. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. After the bath, Harrys family sees him again.

"Often, it is the books enjoying the most official honor  the syllabus standbys, the anthology all-stars  that provide readers with their first experience of literary boredom. Partly that is because the classroom is seldom the best setting for encountering works of literature, which after all were not written to educate, but to seduce. Poetry, Philip Larkin wrote, should rely on cash customers  those who are willing to actually put down money in the expectation of getting something worthwhile, some genuine pleasure, in return. When this hedonistic motive is eliminated, when seduction turns into obligation, its no wonder that readerly appetite cools to mere dutifulness, which is only a half-step from outright boredom."

A classic is by definition a book from another time, and the conventions of the past stand between it and us like a series of locked doors. To learn how to take pleasure in the art of the past  and this is true of music and painting, as much as of literature  usually means passing through an initial period of boredom, just as playing the piano requires learning scales before sonatas. The treasures that lie on the other side of boredom must, at first, be taken on faith, which is why a serious reader is always a humble one, ready to distrust his or her own first impression and rely on the consensus of the past."

"But what feels like boredom, in these cases, might better be described as aggressive estrangement. Proust describes the way genuine innovation in art usually strikes us, at first, as mere incompetence, because it refuses to conform to received aesthetic standards. (The Impressionists, the Cubists, the Pop artists were all accused of simply not knowing how to paint.) This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand?

Centuries of artists and writers and philosophers who have praised boredom (and its genteel cousin, idleness) were probably not simply conspiring to justify lying around on a sofa for more hours than seem obviously necessary. (Though, maybe.) Boredom is a kind of meditation. To be bored is, for a spell, to not let the noise out there get in. Which is also a way of letting something happen in the meager, but essential, in here. To never be bored would be to never be prompted to rupture the boredom. So even as boredom is a kind of failure of perception, it also restores perception. Harry was always Harry, but his family could no longer see that. He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped. He rolled over and played dead. .?.?. But everyone shook their heads."	"The cloak of splendor, is really saying something, no boredom there.

"Often in recognition scenes, someone who had been believed by a character to be dead is revealed as still alive. We see this with Viola and Sebastian in Shakespeares Twelfth Night, with Joseph in the Bible story of his coat of many colors. The recognition, in these stories, is also a kind of resurrection. In boredom, it is the world that had appeared to be dead and that reveals itself as new, as miraculously returned. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. After the bath, Harrys family sees him again.

"Often, it is the books enjoying the most official honor  the syllabus standbys, the anthology all-stars  that provide readers with their first experience of literary boredom. Partly that is because the classroom is seldom the best setting for encountering works of literature, which after all were not written to educate, but to seduce. Poetry, Philip Larkin wrote, should rely on cash customers  those who are willing to actually put down money in the expectation of getting something worthwhile, some genuine pleasure, in return. When this hedonistic motive is eliminated, when seduction turns into obligation, its no wonder that readerly appetite cools to mere dutifulness, which is only a half-step from outright boredom."

This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand?

"But what feels like boredom, in these cases, might better be described as aggressive estrangement. Proust describes the way genuine innovation in art usually strikes us, at first, as mere incompetence, because it refuses to conform to received aesthetic standards. (The Impressionists, the Cubists, the Pop artists were all accused of simply not knowing how to paint.) This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand? Whether the book in question was published 200 years ago or last week, our boredom may turn out to be merely the cloak of its splendor."

"Boredom, in other words, is usually a form of misreading; or as parents warn their children, only boring people get bored. But what if an author seems to be trying to bore us on purpose? Some of the most acclaimed books of recent years  Im thinking in particular of Roberto Bolaos 2666 and Karl Ove Knausgaards My Struggle  contain long stretches in which barely anything happens: Bolao will spend 50 pages listing murder victims, or Knausgaard the same amount of space recounting a walk to a high school party. At such moments they seem to have taken too literally W.H. Audens admonition, in his poem The Novelist, that the novelist must become the whole of boredom."

Proust describes the way genuine innovation in art usually strikes us, at first, as mere incompetence, because it refuses to conform to received aesthetic standards.

This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand? Whether the book in question was published 200 years ago or last week, our boredom may turn out to be merely the cloak of its splendor."

Which is also a way of letting something happen in the meager, but essential, in here. To never be bored would be to never be prompted to rupture the boredom.

This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand? Whether the book in question was published 200 years ago or last week, our boredom may turn out to be merely the cloak of its splendor."	"While Ms. Galchen's essay is a nifty jewel, she has nevertheless (cleverly) dodged the question. Her endless rereading of ""Harry the Dirty Dog"" is a tedious task, but that doesn't mean the book is boring. The book is part of a ritual between parent and child, a medium for interaction. The story may be inane, but boring? Probably not. (As for ""recognition scenes"" and allusions to Shakespeare, that's a bit of a stretch. But nicely done. And all neatly tied up with a bow.) Mr. Kirsch, on the other hand, hit the nail on the head with ""aggressive estrangement"" -- an apt label for the experience a reader has when a book does not click. When I read I need to care about something on the page. It might be the structure and art of the writing that keeps me engaged, or the characters, or just the plot. I might even keep reading out of anger (over lazy writing, too-obvious plot devices, insufferable characters). Whatever the level of fiction I take into hand-- old or new, literature or pulp -- I do need some kind of hook to hold me to the final page. If I am ""bored,"" I am disengaged. If I am disengaged, I'm skimming. And if I am skimming I may as well be watching tv. So I'll toss a ""boring"" book aside and find something that tickles my emotions. That is exactly what I did to one of the most highly lauded novels of 2014, by the way. I thought it stank. So don't listen to me because I am obviously not in the mainstream when it comes to literary criticism. My answer: no."	5

We see this with Viola and Sebastian in Shakespeares Twelfth Night, with Joseph in the Bible story of his coat of many colors. The recognition, in these stories, is also a kind of resurrection. In boredom, it is the world that had appeared to be dead and that reveals itself as new, as miraculously returned.

"Often, it is the books enjoying the most official honor  the syllabus standbys, the anthology all-stars  that provide readers with their first experience of literary boredom. Partly that is because the classroom is seldom the best setting for encountering works of literature, which after all were not written to educate, but to seduce. Poetry, Philip Larkin wrote, should rely on cash customers  those who are willing to actually put down money in the expectation of getting something worthwhile, some genuine pleasure, in return. When this hedonistic motive is eliminated, when seduction turns into obligation, its no wonder that readerly appetite cools to mere dutifulness, which is only a half-step from outright boredom."

A classic is by definition a book from another time, and the conventions of the past stand between it and us like a series of locked doors. To learn how to take pleasure in the art of the past  and this is true of music and painting, as much as of literature  usually means passing through an initial period of boredom, just as playing the piano requires learning scales before sonatas. The treasures that lie on the other side of boredom must, at first, be taken on faith, which is why a serious reader is always a humble one, ready to distrust his or her own first impression and rely on the consensus of the past."

"Boredom, in other words, is usually a form of misreading; or as parents warn their children, only boring people get bored. But what if an author seems to be trying to bore us on purpose? Some of the most acclaimed books of recent years  Im thinking in particular of Roberto Bolaos 2666 and Karl Ove Knausgaards My Struggle  contain long stretches in which barely anything happens: Bolao will spend 50 pages listing murder victims, or Knausgaard the same amount of space recounting a walk to a high school party. At such moments they seem to have taken too literally W.H. Audens admonition, in his poem The Novelist, that the novelist must become the whole of boredom."

"But what feels like boredom, in these cases, might better be described as aggressive estrangement. Proust describes the way genuine innovation in art usually strikes us, at first, as mere incompetence, because it refuses to conform to received aesthetic standards. (The Impressionists, the Cubists, the Pop artists were all accused of simply not knowing how to paint.) This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand? Whether the book in question was published 200 years ago or last week, our boredom may turn out to be merely the cloak of its splendor."	"Boredom, like beauty, is in the eye of the reader (beholder).

"Each week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Rivka Galchen and Adam Kirsch discuss whether boring books might serve an interesting purpose."	"I am curious why Ms. Galchen has been reading ""Harry the Dirty Dog"" three times a day on most days for 16 months. Perhaps she volunteers at a school to do reading readiness screening for 4-year-olds. Perhaps she is employed at a university where they are doing some type of psychological testing on young children. I have read ""Harry the Dirty Dog"" with young children and it is a cute, not boring, children's book, but I shouldn't think anyone would be surprised to find it less interesting after reading it 1440 times in succession. In any case, her discussion seems to be about something different that what Mr. Kirsch is addressing, which is what makes a book boring. I will say that most readers today seem to have less patience with books that aren't fast paced than readers did in previous generations. Even our television shows are mandated to feature multiple plot threads; there must be five murders per mystery show where one used to suffice. The world is replete with people (usually poor) who find themselves required to perform boring, repetitive tasks to make a living. If they are very lucky, the nature of the boring tasks is such that their mind can wander while doing them. What's lethal is a mind-numbingly boring job that you must actually pay mental attention to. Maybe this is part of Ms. Galchen's point; being bored can prompt your mind to be creative."	3

Some of the most acclaimed books of recent years  Im thinking in particular of Roberto Bolaos 2666 and Karl Ove Knausgaards My Struggle  contain long stretches in which barely anything happens: Bolao will spend 50 pages listing murder victims, or Knausgaard the same amount of space recounting a walk to a high school party. At such moments they seem to have taken too literally W.H. Audens admonition, in his poem The Novelist, that the novelist must become the whole of boredom."	"What makes a book boring is: 1. The writing gets in the way of the story. 2. There is no story.

Centuries of artists and writers and philosophers who have praised boredom (and its genteel cousin, idleness) were probably not simply conspiring to justify lying around on a sofa for more hours than seem obviously necessary. (Though, maybe.) Boredom is a kind of meditation. To be bored is, for a spell, to not let the noise out there get in. Which is also a way of letting something happen in the meager, but essential, in here. To never be bored would be to never be prompted to rupture the boredom. So even as boredom is a kind of failure of perception, it also restores perception. Harry was always Harry, but his family could no longer see that. He started to do all his old, clever tricks.

The Benjamin quote that describes the successful result of such ""egg-laying"" is: ""The finished work is the death mask of the experience."" - Obsessive as I can be, too, I can't say I have ever sought to induce boredeom the way that Ms. Galchen has. As to Mr. Kirsch category of happening"" , a very wide one for me, it includes what is happening linguistically, I suppose I get bored if the writer is trite - I can think of several NY Times columnists who induce boredom, and not of a Benjaminesque productive kind."	4

This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand?

This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand?

At such moments they seem to have taken too literally W.H. Audens admonition, in his poem The Novelist, that the novelist must become the whole of boredom."	"Bull's eye has been struck here. Broadly speaking, I'm only slightly removed from this pool of writers, yet they are insular enough to leave me with a feeling of extraterrestrial origin."	1

This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand?

Centuries of artists and writers and philosophers who have praised boredom (and its genteel cousin, idleness) were probably not simply conspiring to justify lying around on a sofa for more hours than seem obviously necessary. (Though, maybe.) Boredom is a kind of meditation. To be bored is, for a spell, to not let the noise out there get in. Which is also a way of letting something happen in the meager, but essential, in here. To never be bored would be to never be prompted to rupture the boredom. So even as boredom is a kind of failure of perception, it also restores perception. Harry was always Harry, but his family could no longer see that. He started to do all his old, clever tricks.

Partly that is because the classroom is seldom the best setting for encountering works of literature, which after all were not written to educate, but to seduce. Poetry, Philip Larkin wrote, should rely on cash customers  those who are willing to actually put down money in the expectation of getting something worthwhile, some genuine pleasure, in return.

Harrys bath worked, like magic. Harry then sleeps, at home, and has happy dreams."	"*2666* isn't boring at all.

"Theres no book so beloved that someone, somewhere, hasnt found it unreadably boring. On Goodreads, in response to the question Whats the most boring book youve ever read?, its a given that the answers will include dense and intimidating volumes like Moby-Dick. But readers have also apparently been bored by a number of books that in their time were considered thrilling and shocking  Lolita, The Catcher in the Rye, even an adventure tale like Around the World in Eighty Days (Felt like I was reading it for 80 days)."

"Often, it is the books enjoying the most official honor  the syllabus standbys, the anthology all-stars  that provide readers with their first experience of literary boredom. Partly that is because the classroom is seldom the best setting for encountering works of literature, which after all were not written to educate, but to seduce. Poetry, Philip Larkin wrote, should rely on cash customers  those who are willing to actually put down money in the expectation of getting something worthwhile, some genuine pleasure, in return. When this hedonistic motive is eliminated, when seduction turns into obligation, its no wonder that readerly appetite cools to mere dutifulness, which is only a half-step from outright boredom."

"But its not only a sense of obligation that can make the classics boring. A classic is by definition a book from another time, and the conventions of the past stand between it and us like a series of locked doors. To learn how to take pleasure in the art of the past  and this is true of music and painting, as much as of literature  usually means passing through an initial period of boredom, just as playing the piano requires learning scales before sonatas. The treasures that lie on the other side of boredom must, at first, be taken on faith, which is why a serious reader is always a humble one, ready to distrust his or her own first impression and rely on the consensus of the past."

"Boredom, in other words, is usually a form of misreading; or as parents warn their children, only boring people get bored. But what if an author seems to be trying to bore us on purpose? Some of the most acclaimed books of recent years  Im thinking in particular of Roberto Bolaos 2666 and Karl Ove Knausgaards My Struggle  contain long stretches in which barely anything happens: Bolao will spend 50 pages listing murder victims, or Knausgaard the same amount of space recounting a walk to a high school party. At such moments they seem to have taken too literally W.H. Audens admonition, in his poem The Novelist, that the novelist must become the whole of boredom."	"*2666* isn't boring at all.

"But what feels like boredom, in these cases, might better be described as aggressive estrangement. Proust describes the way genuine innovation in art usually strikes us, at first, as mere incompetence, because it refuses to conform to received aesthetic standards. (The Impressionists, the Cubists, the Pop artists were all accused of simply not knowing how to paint.) This is not to say that a boring book is always a clandestine work of genius; but it does suggest that a certain kind of boredom  the boredom of incomprehension, rather than the boredom of overfamiliarity  should be taken as a challenge. The most useful question to ask about a boring book is not Why is this author incompetent? but What is this author trying to do that I dont understand? Whether the book in question was published 200 years ago or last week, our boredom may turn out to be merely the cloak of its splendor."	"*2666* isn't boring at all.
